# <h1 align="center">**Mildew Detection in Cherry leaves**</h1>

## Introduction

* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
* The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute.  The company has thousands of cherry trees, located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

The business case assessment interview can be found [here](business_interview.md).

Summary:
* The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
* The client is interested in a dashboard that predicts if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.
* The client would like the dashboard to predict if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew with a 97% accuracy.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them).


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks.


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualised an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course.


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other items, that your dashboard library supports.
* Finally, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project, you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight, but later, you chose another plot type).


## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were unfixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable for consideration, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file. 


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and from where you got extra help. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials. However, it is necessary to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
